    "### `Population` Objects\n",
    "The basic building block of optimization data is a `Population` which is supposed to represent the population of individuals in a single generation of a genetic algorithm. The populations contain the decision variables and the values of the objectives and constraints. All of these are 2D numpy arrays with the first dimension being the batch dimension and having a length equal to the population size. This is true even in the case of not having any constraints (for instance) where the second dimension is set to length zero. It also contains a place to hold the number of function evaluations performed up until this point for use in analyzing performance."
